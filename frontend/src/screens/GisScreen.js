                                        <strong><i>With so many GIS software solutions available on the market, how do we even begin choosing which one to use? In this Section we will give you the background knowledge that you need in order to answer that questions for yourself.</i></strong>
                                        For those of you that have tried looking for GIS software for the first time, there’s one thing that you will know for sure: you aren’t short of choices.

                                        So I guess the first thing you want to know is which one is best? The answer is…

                                        <strong>There is no answer.</strong><br/>

                                        It’s best to think of GIS software like tools in a toolbox, you don’t want to use a screwdriver to bang in a nail. Often GIS solutions will involve a “software stack”.

                                        This means we use several tool in unison. For example, we use a desktop GIS system for creating and modifying our GIS data, then once the data is ready we upload it to a web GIS system in order to distribute the maps within our organization.
